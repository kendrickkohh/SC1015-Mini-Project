# SC1015-Mini-Project
## About

In this project, we discuss the main factors that determine a students success in studies using the dataset of Student Performance from the University of Minho.

We explore the dataset using various models and numerous algorithms to predict a students grades.

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance

For detailed walkthrough please view in the following format:
1. EDA (Boxplot, Scatterplot)
2. EDA (Multi-variate Linear Regression)
3. EDA (Single-variate Linear Regression)
4. EDA (Classification Tree)
5. K-Means Clustering
6. XGBoost_AllVar
7. XGBoost_SelectedVar
8. Neural_Network

## Problem definition
What are main factors that determine a students success in studies? <br />
How a students lifestyle affects his grades?

## Comparison models Used
One hot encoding <br />
Cross-validation <br />
Confusion Matrix <br />
Elbow Plot <br />
Standard Scalar <br />
Decision Tree <br />
Boxplot <br />
Violinplot <br />
Histogram <br />
Heatmap <br />
Pairplot <br />
2D and 3D Scatterplot <br />
Catplot <br />

## Algorithms used
Linear regression <br />
Classification Tree <br />
K-means clustering <br />
XGBoost (decision tree) <br />
Neural Network

## Conclusion
From our analysis, the following are the main factors that result in higher grades: <br />
1) Parents having higher education level <br />
2) Longer weekly study time <br />
3) Better quality of family relationships <br />
4) Lower levels of alcohol consumption on both workdays and weekends <br />
5) Lower health levels <br />
6) Lower numbers of school absences <br />
